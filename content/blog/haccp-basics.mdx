# Understanding HACCP: The Foundation of Food Safety

HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points) is a systematic preventive approach to food safety that addresses physical, chemical, and biological hazards as a means of prevention rather than finished product inspection.

## The Seven Principles of HACCP

1. **Conduct a Hazard Analysis** - Identify potential hazards in your food production process
2. **Determine Critical Control Points (CCPs)** - Identify points where hazards can be prevented, eliminated, or reduced
3. **Establish Critical Limits** - Set maximum or minimum values for each CCP
4. **Establish Monitoring Procedures** - Determine how to monitor each CCP
5. **Establish Corrective Actions** - Define actions to take when monitoring shows a CCP is not under control
6. **Establish Verification Procedures** - Confirm that the HACCP system is working effectively
7. **Establish Record-Keeping** - Document all procedures and records

## Why HACCP Matters

HACCP is recognized internationally as the most effective way to ensure food safety. It helps organizations:

- Prevent foodborne illnesses
- Comply with regulatory requirements
- Reduce product recalls
- Improve operational efficiency
- Build consumer confidence

## Getting Started with HACCP

Implementing HACCP requires commitment from management and training for all staff members. Start by assembling a HACCP team with diverse expertise in your food operations.
