# Allergen Management in Food Service

Food allergies affect millions of people worldwide and can cause severe, life-threatening reactions. Proper allergen management is essential for any food service operation.

## Understanding Food Allergies

### What is a Food Allergy?

A food allergy is an immune system response to a food protein that the body mistakenly identifies as harmful. Even tiny amounts can trigger reactions.

### Severity of Reactions

Reactions can range from mild to severe:
- **Mild**: Hives, itching, nasal congestion
- **Moderate**: Difficulty breathing, stomach pain, dizziness
- **Severe**: Anaphylaxis - a life-threatening reaction requiring immediate medical attention

## Major Food Allergens

### The Big 8 (USA)

1. **Milk** - Most common in children
2. **Eggs** - Second most common in children
3. **Fish** - Includes all finned fish
4. **Shellfish** - Crustaceans and mollusks
5. **Tree Nuts** - Almonds, walnuts, cashews, etc.
6. **Peanuts** - Actually a legume, not a nut
7. **Wheat** - Different from gluten intolerance
8. **Soybeans** - Found in many processed foods

### Additional Allergens (EU and other regions)

- Celery
- Mustard
- Sesame
- Lupin
- Sulfites (preservatives)

## Allergen Management Program

### 1. Allergen Assessment

Identify all allergens in your facility:
- Review all recipes and ingredients
- Check supplier specifications
- Identify hidden allergens in additives
- Create an allergen matrix

### 2. Supplier Management

Work with suppliers to:
- Obtain allergen declarations
- Verify allergen information
- Establish change notification procedures
- Audit supplier practices

### 3. Ingredient Receiving

At receiving:
- Verify allergen information on labels
- Check for supplier changes
- Segregate allergenic ingredients
- Document allergen presence

### 4. Storage Procedures

Proper storage prevents cross-contact:
- Store allergens separately when possible
- Use sealed containers
- Label clearly with allergen warnings
- Store allergens below non-allergen items
- Implement color-coding system

### 5. Production Controls

During food preparation:
- Use dedicated equipment for allergen-free items
- Schedule allergen-free production first
- Create physical barriers between allergen zones
- Use separate utensils and cutting boards
- Implement visual controls (colored tools)

### 6. Cleaning and Sanitation

Effective cleaning removes allergen residues:
- Clean between allergen and non-allergen production
- Use validated cleaning procedures
- Verify cleaning effectiveness
- Train staff on proper techniques
- Document all cleaning activities

## Preventing Cross-Contact

### What is Cross-Contact?

Cross-contact occurs when an allergen is unintentionally transferred to a food that doesn't normally contain it.

### Common Sources

- Shared equipment
- Shared utensils
- Airborne particles (flour, powders)
- Splash and spills
- Hand contact
- Shared fryer oil

### Prevention Strategies

**Equipment**:
- Use dedicated equipment for allergen-free items
- Clean thoroughly between uses
- Validate cleaning effectiveness
- Consider equipment design (easy to clean)

**Utensils**:
- Color-code by allergen
- Use disposable items when possible
- Store separately
- Never share between allergen and non-allergen foods

**Workspace**:
- Separate preparation areas
- Physical barriers
- Designated allergen-free zones
- Clear signage

**Personal Practices**:
- Change gloves between tasks
- Wash hands frequently
- Change aprons if contaminated
- No touching face or hair

## Staff Training

### Essential Training Topics

All staff must understand:
- What food allergies are
- Severity of reactions
- Major allergens
- Cross-contact prevention
- Cleaning procedures
- Emergency response
- Communication protocols

### Training Methods

- Initial orientation
- Hands-on demonstrations
- Regular refresher courses
- Competency testing
- Visual aids and posters
- Role-playing scenarios

### Documentation

Maintain records of:
- Training dates and topics
- Attendees
- Test results
- Competency assessments

## Menu Labeling and Communication

### Menu Information

Provide clear allergen information:
- List all allergens in each dish
- Use consistent symbols or icons
- Include warnings about cross-contact risk
- Update menus when recipes change

### Customer Communication

Train staff to:
- Take allergen requests seriously
- Never guess about ingredients
- Check with kitchen if unsure
- Inform customers of cross-contact risks
- Document special requests

### Sample Dialogue

**Customer**: "I have a severe peanut allergy. Is this dish safe?"

**Staff**: "Let me check with the kitchen to be absolutely certain. We take allergies very seriously and want to make sure we can prepare your meal safely."

## Special Requests and Modifications

### Handling Allergen-Free Orders

1. **Receive Request**: Listen carefully and document
2. **Verify**: Confirm ingredients and preparation method
3. **Communicate**: Alert kitchen staff clearly
4. **Prepare**: Use clean equipment and dedicated space
5. **Verify**: Double-check before serving
6. **Deliver**: Identify allergen-free meal clearly

### Kitchen Communication

Use clear systems:
- Special order tickets
- Colored plates or flags
- Verbal confirmation
- Dedicated prep area
- Manager oversight

## Emergency Response

### Recognizing Allergic Reactions

Signs of anaphylaxis:
- Difficulty breathing
- Swelling of throat or tongue
- Rapid pulse
- Dizziness or fainting
- Skin reactions (hives, flushing)

### Emergency Action Plan

1. **Call Emergency Services** (911 or local equivalent)
2. **Administer Epinephrine** if available and trained
3. **Keep Person Calm** and lying down
4. **Monitor Vital Signs**
5. **Document Incident**
6. **Follow Up** with investigation

### Staff Preparedness

- Know location of first aid kit
- Know how to use epinephrine auto-injector
- Know emergency contact numbers
- Practice emergency scenarios
- Stay calm and act quickly

## Documentation and Record Keeping

### Essential Records

Maintain documentation of:
- Allergen matrix for all products
- Supplier allergen declarations
- Cleaning verification
- Staff training
- Customer requests
- Incidents and near-misses

### Traceability

Ensure you can trace:
- Ingredients to suppliers
- Allergen presence in products
- Production dates and batches
- Distribution of products

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews

Periodically review:
- Allergen management procedures
- Incident reports
- Near-miss events
- Customer feedback
- New regulations
- Industry best practices

### Auditing

Conduct regular audits:
- Internal inspections
- Third-party audits
- Surprise checks
